<h2>A funny story</h2>

<p>Once, some years ago, I was laureat in a poetry contest. I came in a little party for the winner, I was with my family and an other laureat (who was my friend and now my girlfriend). In this short party, they had a gigs. The muscician was a french. He had a very particular style, play with a untuned guitar and sing nonsens lyric. My family, my friend and my laught a lot cause its was very strange and unexpectd.</p>
 
<h3>TL;DR</h3>   

<p>Short story about a funny thing who happen to me several years ago. A unexpected concert of a particular french.</p>
